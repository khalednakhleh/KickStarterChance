# ECEN 649 Project

For the course's project, we chose to apply machine learning algorithms on a kickstarter projects' dataset.
Our objective is to find the best combination of labels that would increase a project's success rate.
In other words, what project would be the most likely to get funded and succeed as a product.
We define "succeed" here as a project that was successfully funded.

### The Kickstarter 300,000 projects' dataset

Our dataset can be found here:

https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects

The dataset we are using contains over 300,000 projects that were hosted by Kickstarter, and last updated in 2018.

The dataset contains 15 labels (ID, name, main_category, etc). Our methodology is to compare which projects succeded,
and develop a model that predicts a project's success based on those factors.
 We want to also visualize our findings and model, in order to better understand which projects are more likely to get funded.

### Summary

We are using the Kickstarter projects to train a model that predicts the chances a new "test" project will succeed.
